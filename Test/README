This file contains the 20 juliet test cases used in the final test on which we used the machine learning methods 
contained within ML.py to classify them as either good or bad. 
The two csv files contain the actual list of features that the two python files testvalues and train values were used to compare
the test cases to in order to extract the float values/ levels of similarity that would be used in the machine learning program.
